       <h1>Inine Elements</h1>
        <p>Why do we bother with Inline elements?These are ceertainly times we want ot mark up content,but we don't want to insert the line breaks around them.The &lt;span&gt; tag was the firstto give you that ability,but it was mostly used to style the code,and we Don't want to do that.Some of the newer tags that still separate content and style are listed below.Remember,inline tags can flow next to each other and don't cause a line break before and after the element.We have seen this with links and images. </p>
